 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying this License.

  You may convey a copy of this License along with every copy of the
Library.  You may place a copy of this License in every Combined Work.

  3. Conveying Works Based on the Library.

  You may convey such Combined Works under terms of your choice, provided
that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use
and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
stating that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If
the Combined Work during execution displays copyright notices, you must
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well
as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the Library used to
    create the Combined Work.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the user a copy of the Library used to
    create the Combined Work.

    c) If the Combined Work is a work based on the Library, convey a
    copy of the Library along with the Combined Work.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may not copy, modify, propagate, or distribute a Combined Work
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, propagate or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
